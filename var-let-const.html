    <h3>VAR vs LET vs CONST</h3>
    <p>var is keyword - if we declare a variable with var ,then variable is consider to be a global scope,if variable declare with var inside the function,it can be used inside the function only</p><br>
    <p>let is keyword - let is used for block level access(only inside the curly braces{})</p><br>
    <p>const is keyword - const is used for block level access but we cannot REASSIGNED to the const declared variable</p>
    <script>
        var a = 10;//a have global 
        console.log("Global Access");
        console.log(a);
        {
            console.log("block 1");
            console.log(`inside the block also global variable a worked a = ${a}`);
            let b = 20;
            const c= 30;
            console.log(`block 1, b = ${b},we cannot used b block 2`);
            console.log(`we cannot use const value in block 2 c = ${c}`);
            //we cannot reassign to to the const variable
            c=40;
            console.log(c);//error occur
        }
        {
            //cannot use let and const value in another block
            console.log("block 2");
            console.log({b,c});//error occur
        }
